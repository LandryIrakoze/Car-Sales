**Step 2 - And... Action! ðŸŽ¬**
- This is the flow that works for me:

ðŸ‘‰ Set up "empty" reducer and initial state 
ðŸ‘‰ Set up store and Provider 
ðŸ‘‰ Connect components 
ðŸ‘‰ Add events and event handlers in UI 
ðŸ‘‰ Build action creators 
ðŸ‘‰ write the reducer logic for the actions 
ðŸ‘‰ Rinse and repeat

## _MVP Requirements:_
- Move the given state to the reducer as the initial state for the Redux store.
- Set up the Redux flow
- User should be able to add features to their car
- User should be able to remove added features from their car
- Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car

## Stretch Problems
- Use Redux hooks instead of HOCs
- Implement React-Router and add a starter page where the user can choose a car. Each car should have different features that have different pricing. Have fun with this! It could end up being really cool.
- Look into the docs for Bulma and change up the styling.
- Implement an API from one of these sites [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=car+sales+api&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS809US809&oq=car+sales+api&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3580j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). I don't know if there are any good open APIs for this, so explore around. Check out what data these APIs return, and what you think would be fun to work with. The sky is the limit here!
